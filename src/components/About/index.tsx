        Hey. I&apos;m Jeff - a Full Stack Developer with around 6 years of experience and a passion for working on projects that will 
        teach me something new. I&apos;ve worked on building customer facing E-Commerce sites alongside teams of developers, designing 
        backend systems and workflows for small businesses, launched Google Play and Windows applications, created custom 
        algorithms for determining monthly subscription products, led large database migrations, and more. I don&apos;t like to hold 
        myself down to one tech stack, and will learn what is necessary to get a project up and running.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you have an idea for something unique, I&apos;d be more than happy to help.
